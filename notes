BINANCE SMART CHAIN RESEARCH:
- many wallets (metamask, truste wallet, binance chain wallet...)
  - metamask integration = https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain
  - fund testnet account = https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/binance-dex-funding-your-testnet-account
- Binance Smart Chain (BSC) = BEP-20 standard, Binance Chain (BC) = BEP-2 standard
  - same native currency BNB
  - BEP = binance evolution proposal (similar to EIP for ethereum)
  - there exists a bridge between BSC and BNB to swap assets = https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/guides/panama.html
  - add money to BSC using binance account or binance brigde
- example apps:
  - PancakeSwap = automatic money maker + token swapper
  - Venus = borrow-lending protocol
  - Autofarm = tries to find best way to earn a yield on your deposits
- https://bscscan.com/ = etherscan for BSC, also provides web API (free, but limited)
- Binance chain = ultra fast trading, bad programatic experience, BSC - better programatic exp.
- BNB launched april 2019
- BSC = EVM based, seamless transfer for BNB
- docs = https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/guides/bsc-intro.html
  - ecosystem = https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc-ecosystem
  - compatible with ETH tools = https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/guides/concepts/consensus.html

QUESTIONS:
- What is BSC exactly? = its a POSA (proof of stake authority) EVM based chain = short block length + low fees
- what is binance? = different blockchain, not EVM based
- difference between BSC and BNB? = BNB not EVM compatible, low (or none?) smart contract support, BSC = EVM based, compatible with EVM tooling


OTHER NOTES:
- AMM = decentralized exchange, using math formula to price assets
- Binance chain urls:
  - API = https://docs.binance.org/api-reference/dex-api/ws-connection.html
  - SDK = https://github.com/binance-chain/javascript-sdk

STAKING:
- Staking for BSC using BC chain
- only 21 validators
  - minimum 10000 BNB = 2,800,000 USD (https://paybis.com/bnb-to-usd/10000/)
- can stake by delegation (https://docs.binance.org/faq/bsc/del.html)
  - minimum 1 BNB
  - receive rewards nearly every day
  - staking is safe even when the validator is slashed
  - https://docs.binance.org/guides/concepts/bc-staking.html TODO:
    - BC supports staking so they used it for BSC
    - validator changes on BC are propagetd to BSC every day
    - staking rewards happen on BSC and is transfered back to BC every day
    - there are technical examples for delegation/staking using their CLI
  - where to connect? https://docs.binance.org/api-reference/cli.html
    - you download the CLI and connect to one of the BSC nodes
    - side chain id is "bsc" for mainnet, "chapel" for testnet
  - https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/delegator/del-guide.html#delegate-with-binance-chain-command-line
    - list current validators and choose the one to support (https://testnet-dex.binance.org/api/v1/peers)
    - create a binance account - there is a link above, but didn't work
      - didn't work as well: https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain
      - I ended up with this: https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/binance.html#binance.html#transfer-testnet-bnb-from-bsc-to-bc
